I was able to make my first drawing and print it. But when I did my second drawing all heck broke loose.
It first printed the whole drawing in a box about a tenth of an inch square (way way too small).  I went on line and got what I 
 thought was good advice about... Paper size, Fit to page, Units, Scale ("fixed and unfixed" box), uncheck "print to file",
 and Center Page.  But then I was printing blank pages no matter what I did.  I looked at very nice Youtube video about
 printing and it looked so simple and easy to do, but still no joy.  BTW he (Gary Fox?) was able to see the changes on screen instantly. 
 My libracad did not have some of the Icons he had, and the screen did not automatically adjust to the changes I made.
 I have about 8 hours into this drawing and have saved it in several forms and stages.  I don't want to start over.  Any suggestions?
